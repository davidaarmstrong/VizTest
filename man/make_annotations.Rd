\title{Make Annotations for Significance Brackets}
\usage{
make_annotations(
  obj,
  type = c("auto", "significant", "insignificant"),
  tol = 0,
  nudge = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{An object of class \code{viztest} produced by the \code{viztest()} function.}

\item{type}{Indicates whether annotations are produced for overlapping intervals that are significantly different from each other or not. The \code{"auto"} option will
find the type that produces the fewest annotations.}

\item{tol}{Tolerance for determining whether intervals are close enough to be considered ambiguous.  This also plots significance flags for intervals that
do not overlap, but the distance between them is smaller than the tolerance.  The default is zero, but increasing the value will potentially produce more significance flags.}

\item{nudge}{A vector of the same length as the number of brackets.  This will nudge the y-position of the brakcet by the indicated amount.  This will be difficult to
specify ahead of time, but can be specified to clean up a plot after an initial run.}

\item{...}{Other arguments, currently ignored.}
}
\description{
Makes a list of annotations for significance brakcets produced by the \code{geom_signif()} function from the \code{ggsignif} package.  The annotations are added for
pairs of estimates whose confidence intervals overlap, but the estimates are nonetheless significantly different from each other.
